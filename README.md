# Ditto | AI Digital Clone Workspace 🤖

> **Build your own AI-powered digital clone that learns your texting style from your WhatsApp chat history and generates replies that sound like you.**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Ditto** is an AI-powered digital clone workspace that creates a personalized chat assistant by analyzing a user's writing patterns from exported WhatsApp conversations. 

Rather than generating generic AI responses, Ditto mimics the user's natural communication habits—including tone, vocabulary, emojis, reply speed, average message length, punctuation, and common phrases. It is designed to assist busy professionals, creators, and teams in drafting replies that feel authentic and uniquely theirs.

* **Signature Vocabulary**: Detects key words/phrases you repeat frequently.
* **Message Length Patterns**: Measures short-to-medium vs long paragraph style habits.
